You’re in the right place. This guide walks you through choosing templates, formatting for print, and customizing your document so it feels polished, personal, and professional.</p><h2>Why Google Docs Makes a Great Invitation Tool</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Free and collaborative:</strong> Edit together with your partner or planner, anywhere.</li>
  <li><strong>Simple customization:</strong> Choose from ready-made designs, change fonts, wording, and even insert personal images.</li>
  <li><strong>Printable at home or through a print shop:</strong> Set up layouts to standard sizes like 5×7 inches easily.</li>
</ul>
<p>Platforms like TheGoodocs and Gdoc.io offer dozens of wedding invite templates—minimal, vintage, floral, rustic, modern styles—all built to work seamlessly in Google Docs.</p><h2>How to Set Up a 5×7 Invitation in Google Docs</h2><h3>Step 1: Create a Landscape Letter Document</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Open a new blank doc.</li>
  <li>Go to <strong>File → Page setup</strong>.</li>
  <li>Select <em>Landscape</em> orientation, size <em>Letter (8.5 × 11 in)</em>, and set all margins to about 0.5″ to prevent trimming issues.</li>
</ul><h3>Step 2: Insert and Size a Two‑Column Table</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Insert a table with one row and two columns.</li>
  <li>Open Table Properties: set each column width to 5″ and row height to approximately 7″.</li>
  <li>Optionally add a faint border line (0.5 pt, light gray) to act as a cutting guide.</li>
</ul><h3>Step 3: Add Your Invitation Content</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Write the invitation text—names, date, venue, RSVP details—centered in the first cell.</li>
  <li>Choose an elegant font like Allura for names and a readable font like EB Garamond or Arial for details.</li>
</ul><h3>Step 4: Duplicate to Second Cell</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Select all text in the first cell, copy and paste into the second.</li>
  <li>Ensure formatting matches exactly so both halves print identically.</li>
</ul><h3>Step 5: Print and Trim</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Use File → Print or export to PDF.</li>
  <li>Ensure: paper size is Letter, scale is 100%, orientation is landscape.</li>
  <li>Print test page, then cut straight down the center at about 5.5″ to yield two 5 × 7 invitations.</li>
  <li>Use cardstock (80–110 lb) for a professional feel; commercial printers work fine too.</li>
</ul><h2>Template Sources and Style Options</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Minimal and formal:</strong> Classic black-and-white or gold-accent styles on Gdoc.io and TheGoodocs—ideal for elegant ceremonies.</li>
  <li><strong>Rustic or floral:</strong> Designs featuring wood textures, floral borders, or gradient accents for casual or outdoorsy events .</li>
  <li><strong>Modern or pastel:</strong> Soft colors, clean typography, subtle graphics—great for spring or contemporary weddings.</li>

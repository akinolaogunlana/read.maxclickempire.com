<p>While many students rely on third-party planner apps or pre-printed diaries, Google Docs remains one of the most flexible, accessible, and free options for academic planning. With cloud access, collaborative editing, and printable layout formats, you can personalize your planner from any device.</p><h3>Key Advantages</h3>

  <li><strong>Cross-Device Access:</strong> Use on phones, tablets, and laptops — no app needed.</li>
  <li><strong>Printable:</strong> Prefer analog? Print weekly or monthly views with full formatting control.</li>
  <li><strong>Sharable:</strong> Collaborate with classmates or mentors directly in Docs.</li>
</ul><h2>2025 Academic Year Planning: What to Include</h2>
<p>The 2025 academic year typically spans from August 2025 through July 2026. A solid planner layout should incorporate both calendar overviews and task-tracking features:</p><h3>Essential Components</h3>

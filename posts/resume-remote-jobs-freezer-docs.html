<p>Remote jobs are no longer just a trend‚Äîthey‚Äôre the new normal. But landing one requires more than just experience. Your resume must scream ‚Äúremote-ready,‚Äù pass applicant tracking systems (ATS), and prove you can work independently. The right Google Docs template can do all three. In this guide, you'll get a plug-and-play resume layout specifically crafted for remote positions‚Äî100% free, professionally designed, and ATS-friendly.</p>

<h2>Why Remote Resumes Must Be Different</h2>
<p>Remote employers are looking for more than just skills. They want proof of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Excellent communication skills (written and verbal)</li>
  <li>Self-discipline and time management</li>
  <li>Tech-savviness and remote collaboration experience</li>
  <li>Results over hours‚Äîdeliverables, not just duties</li>
</ul>

<h3>How Most Resumes Fail</h3>
<p>Generic resumes often miss these remote-specific signals. They focus too much on task lists, fail to mention remote tools like Slack or Zoom, and skip over accomplishments that prove autonomy.</p>

<h2>The Anatomy of a Remote-Optimized Resume</h2>
<p>To stand out in a global pool of applicants, structure your resume with these key elements:</p>

<h3>1. Remote-Specific Summary</h3>
<p>Start with a short paragraph that highlights your remote work experience, adaptability, and communication skills.</p>

<h3>2. Results-Driven Work History</h3>
<p>Use bullet points that showcase measurable achievements‚Äîespecially in virtual teams.</p>

<h3>3. Tech Proficiency</h3>
<p>Mention tools like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Slack, Trello, Notion</li>
  <li>Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams</li>
  <li>Time-tracking tools like Toggl or Harvest</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. Time Zone Flexibility</h3>
<p>If you're open to asynchronous work or flexible hours, say so directly. This is a huge advantage.</p>

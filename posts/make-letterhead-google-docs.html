<h2>How to Create a Letterhead in Google Docs</h2>

<p>Start by opening Google Docs and creating a new blank document. Go to <strong>docs.google.com</strong>, and click on “Blank” to start fresh.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Set Up Your Page Layout</h3>
<p>Before you start adding content, set up your page layout for your letterhead:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click on <strong>File</strong> in the top left corner.</li>
  <li>Choose <strong>Page setup</strong> from the dropdown.</li>
  <li>Select the paper size you want (usually "Letter" for business correspondence).</li>
  <li>Set your margins. Typically, a 1-inch margin is ideal for letterhead.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>OK</strong> to apply your settings.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Step 3: Add Your Company Logo</h3>
<p>Adding a logo is one of the most important elements of a letterhead. To add your company logo:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click on <strong>Insert</strong> in the top menu.</li>
  <li>Choose <strong>Image</strong> and select where you’d like to upload your logo (from your computer, Google Drive, or online).</li>
  <li>Resize and reposition your logo so it fits neatly in the header of your document.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Step 4: Add Your Company Information</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Click at the top of the document where the header is located.</li>
  <li>Type your company’s name and contact information in the header. Use bold fonts for your company name to make it stand out.</li>
  <li>Consider adding social media handles or a tagline, if applicable, in smaller text.</li>
  <li>Align the text as needed (left, center, or right). Many companies opt for a centered header, but you can choose what looks best for your brand.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 5: Design Your Footer</h3>
<p>The footer of your letterhead can include additional information like your business’s registration number, bank details, or a slogan. To add a footer:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click on <strong>Insert</strong> again and choose <strong>Footer</strong>.</li>
  <li>Type the information you want to include in the footer.</li>
  <li>Adjust the font size and alignment to make sure it fits well with your overall design.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Step 6: Final Touches and Formatting</h3>
<p>Once you have your logo, company info, and footer in place, it’s time to refine your design:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use bold, italics, or underline to highlight important details.</li>
  <li>Choose fonts that align with your brand’s image (Google Docs offers a variety of free fonts).</li>
  <li>Adjust the font size and spacing to make sure everything fits comfortably on the page.</li>
</ul>

  <li>Click on <strong>File</strong> in the top-left corner and select <strong>Save as template</strong> if you want to keep it for repeated use in Google Docs.</li>
  <li>Alternatively, you can simply save the document as a template in your Google Drive.</li>
  <li>To use your letterhead in the future, open the saved document, make a copy, and replace the body text with your content.</li>

      <h1>Delivery Note Template in Google Docs — Free, Printable &amp; Mobile-Friendly</h1>



<p><strong>Fast fact:</strong> A clear delivery note—kept with your packing slips and invoices—reduces disputes and speeds reconciliation. This guide gives a copy-paste <a href="/posts/google-docs-resume-template-fresh-graduates.html" title="Google Docs resume template for fresh graduates">Google</a> Docs layout, explains which fields truly matter, and shows low-tech workflows small shops can actually use.</p><h2>What a delivery note is (and why your small business needs one)</h2>
<p>A delivery note (sometimes called a delivery receipt or packing slip in casual use) is the document that lists the goods delivered to a customer or store location. Unlike an invoice, a delivery note typically focuses on items and quantities rather than payment details. Including delivery notes in your fulfillment process helps verify what arrived, who accepted it, and the condition at delivery—critical for returns and claims.</p><h3>Delivery note vs packing slip vs invoice — practical differences for fulfillment</h3>
<p>Use this simple rule of thumb: <strong>Delivery note / packing slip</strong> = what’s in the box; <strong>Invoice</strong> = what’s owed. Some vendors use the terms interchangeably, but for reliable operations keep them distinct—delivery notes for receiving and condition checks, invoices for accounting. This distinction is emphasized by industry explainers and template libraries.</p><h2>Core fields every delivery note must include</h2>
<p>Keep your delivery note minimal but complete—this improves on-the-spot checks and avoids confusion later.</p><h3>Header fields: shipper, recipient, delivery date, and reference numbers</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Document title:</strong> “Delivery Note” or “Delivery Receipt.”</li>
  <li><strong>Delivery note number / reference:</strong> unique identifier for tracking.</li>
  <li><strong>Ship date / delivery date:</strong> when goods were dispatched and when received.</li>
  <li><strong>Shipper (supplier) details:</strong> company name, contact person, phone/email.</li>
  <li><strong>Recipient (delivery-to) details:</strong> customer/store name, address, phone, and any internal receiving location.</li>
  <li><strong>Order or PO reference:</strong> cross-reference to your PO or sales order.</li>
</ul><h3>Line items: SKU, description, qty, unit, and condition notes</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>SKU / supplier code:</strong> helps pickers and receivers match items quickly.</li>
  <li><strong>Description:</strong> short but precise (size, color, variant).</li>
  <li><strong>Qty delivered:</strong> critical for receiving and stock updates.</li>
  <li><strong>Unit:</strong> e.g., each, box, pack.</li>
  <li><strong>Condition / notes:</strong> space to record damages, missing pieces, or substitutions.</li>
</ul><h3>Footer: receiver signature, condition, and discrepancy notes</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Received by:</strong> name and signature — proof of delivery and acceptance.</li>
  <li><strong>Date &amp; time:</strong> when the items were accepted.</li>
  <li><strong>Discrepancy notes:</strong> quick bullet area for shortages or damage.</li>
  <li><strong>Optional:</strong> field for the carrier/tracking number or vehicle details.</li>
</ul><h2>Google Docs vs Google Sheets vs ready templates — which to use and when</h2>
<p>Choosing the right tool depends on volume and repeatability.</p><h3>When to use Google Docs (printable, professional delivery notes) — quick checklist</h3>
<ul>
  <li>You send a delivery note once per order and want a clean, branded PDF.</li>
  <li>Your receiving staff prefer paper or a single PDF per delivery.</li>
  <li>You want a template that looks like a letterhead and prints consistently.</li>
</ul><h3>When Sheets is better (bulk packing lists, calculations, and auditor logs)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Use Sheets when you generate dozens of packing lists, need formulas for totals, or keep a running receiving log.</li>
  <li>Sheets also works better when you plan to merge many rows into a single template programmatically.</li>
</ul><h3>Where to get ready templates (free &amp; editable sources)</h3>
<p>If you want a ready-made layout you can import to Google Docs, reputable template libraries and small-business sites offer polished options (<a href="/posts/free-google-docs-resume-career-changers.html" title="Free Google Docs resume for career changers">free</a> and editable). Popular sources include HubSpot’s template library and template marketplaces that supply .docx/.gdoc formats—handy if you need multiple style choices quickly</p><h2>Build a clean delivery note in Google Docs — step-by-step (copy-ready)</h2>
<p>Below is a clean, printer-friendly delivery note layout you can copy into a new <a href="/posts/cover-letter-template-matching-resume.html" title="Google Docs cover letter template with matching resume">Google</a> Doc. I’ll also explain simple formatting choices to keep the document readable on phones and printers.</p><h3>Page setup, branding, and simple layout tips for mobile/print readability</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Open Google Docs → Blank document. Go to <strong>File → Page setup</strong> and select A4 or Letter (your regional preference). Set 1" margins for reliable printing.</li>
  <li>Insert your logo at the top left (Insert → Image). Keep it small — this saves space on mobile screenshots and printed slips.</li>
  <li>Use a readable font size: store name 14–16 pt bold; body 11–12 pt. Avoid dense paragraphs — your receiver will scan the line items, not the fine print.</li>
</ol><h3>Create the items table and receiving section (copy-paste-ready layout)</h3>
<p>Copy everything between the dashed lines into a fresh Google Doc, then customize your store name and contact details.</p><p>––––– copy starts –––––</p>

<p>––––– copy ends –––––</p><h3>Save, reuse, and share: make-copy + export-to-PDF workflow</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Rename the Doc to “Delivery Note Template.” For each delivery, use <strong>File → Make a copy</strong> and fill in the fields.</li>
  <li>To send a locked copy, select <strong>File → Download → PDF</strong> and attach to your carrier or customer email.</li>
  <li>For signed proof, the receiver can sign the printed page or sign a PDF with a phone-based signature app and email it back.</li>
</ol><h2>Optional: lightweight fulfillment workflow for stores (no heavy software)</h2>
<p>Small shops don’t need complex systems to track deliveries. Use two simple artifacts:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Delivery Note copy</strong> filed with the shipment and scanned into a shared folder (Google Drive).</li>
  <li><strong>Receiving log (Google Sheet)</strong> that lists delivery note number, date, who received, and status (Received / Partial / Damaged).</li>
</ul><h3>How to issue, sign, and file delivery notes in a day-to-day shop</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Warehouse/driver brings goods and leaves a printed delivery note with the receiver.</li>
  <li>Receiver inspects, signs, and returns one copy to the driver; retain one copy for records.</li>
  <li>Scan or photograph the signed delivery note and upload to a shared Drive folder named by month for easy retrieval during reconciliation.</li>
</ol><h3>Receiving best-practices: quick checklists and three-way checks (PO/invoice/delivery note)</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Quick receiving checklist:</strong> verify SKU, qty, condition, and sign the delivery note.</li>
  <li><strong>Three-way check:</strong> match the delivery note to the PO (or sales order) and the supplier invoice before approving payment—this prevents paying for items you didn’t get.</li>
  <li>Flag mismatches immediately: note them on the delivery note, take photos, and email the supplier referencing the delivery note number.</li>
</ul><h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><h3>Q: What’s the difference between a delivery note and a packing slip?</h3>
<p>A: The terms overlap; many sellers call both documents “packing slips.” Functionally, a delivery note focuses on items and quantities received and often includes a receiver signature, while a packing slip may be more internal and tied to the shipment process. Use the name that your suppliers and carriers understand, but always include the same essential fields. </p><h3>Q: Can I use the delivery note as proof of delivery for claims?</h3>
<p>A: Yes—if the delivery note includes a receiver signature, date, and notes about condition, it is strong evidence in disputes over short shipments or damage.</p><h3>Q: Is pricing included on delivery notes?</h3>
<p>A: Typically no. Delivery notes focus on items and quantities. Invoices handle pricing and payment terms. If you want both, attach the invoice to the delivery note or include a reference to the invoice number.</p><h3>Q: Where can I download editable Google Docs delivery note templates?</h3>
<p>A: Reputable template libraries and <a href="/posts/business-letter-template-google-docs-formal-format.html" title="Business Letter Template Google Docs (Formal Format)">business</a> template providers offer editable templates in Google Docs format—HubSpot, Template.net, and other small-business sites are good starting points. Always review and adapt templates to your operations. </p><h3>Q: Should I scan and store delivery notes digitally?</h3>
<p>A: Yes—scanning signed delivery notes into a dated cloud folder preserves evidence and speeds reconciliation with invoices. Use a consistent naming convention like <em>DN-YYYYMMDD-0001</em> for easy search.</p><p><strong>Conclusion &amp; call to action:</strong> Copy the layout above into a new Google Doc, customize the placeholders, and standardize the “received by” process at your store. If you’d like, I can convert this delivery note into a downloadable Google Doc template and a matching Google Sheet receiving log you can start using today—tell me which file format you prefer (Docs only, Docs + Sheet, or a single combined Pack List Sheet).</p><!--

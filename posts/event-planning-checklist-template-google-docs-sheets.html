Whether you're organizing a wedding, corporate gathering, or community meetup, a well‑structured template in Google Docs or Sheets can be a lifeline. This guide shows you how to set one up quickly, with tips shared by real planners and assistants to keep everything organized.</p><h2>Why Use Docs or Sheets for Event Planning</h2>
<h3>Accessible anywhere and highly collaborative</h3>
<p>Google Docs and Sheets let you collaborate in real time with partners, vendors, or team members—no version confusion, no back‑and‑forth file edits.</p>
<h3>Flexible format—document or spreadsheet</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Google Docs is great for formatted checklists, contracts, proposals.</li>
  <li>Sheets excels at tracking tasks, budgets, guest lists, and timelines.</li>
</ul><h2>What Real Planners Recommend (Insights from Reddit)</h2>
<p>On communities like <em>r/weddingplanning</em> and <em>r/ExecutiveAssistants</em>, professionals share their own free templates and advice:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Many talk about a comprehensive Google Sheets workbook with 30–36 pages covering priorities, timelines, budgets, seating, vendor tracking, honeymoon, and more.</li>
  <li>A planner in executive admin recommended using agency‑designed toolkits (Event Kit) or built‑in Google Sheets templates—some provide a full planning flow without building from scratch.</li>
  <li>One Redditor suggested starting with a “must haves / nice to haves / avoid” priority list and merging lists with your event partner to keep decisions aligned.</li>
</ul><h2>Building a Best‑In‑Class Template</h2>
<h3>Step 1: Define Your Core Worksheets</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Priorities & Vision</strong>: What matters most? Include categories like “must‑have,” “nice‑to‑have,” and “avoid,” based on real planner posts .</li>
  <li><strong>Master Timeline</strong>: Month‑by‑month, week‑by‑week schedule. Anchor major milestones like venue booking, invitations, final confirmations.</li>
  <li><strong>Guest & RSVP Tracker</strong>: Names, contact info, RSVP status, plus‑ones, dietary needs, accommodation, RSVP deadlines.</li>
  <li><strong>Budget & Expense Breakdown</strong>: Categories (venue, catering, decor), allocated versus actual, notes, vendor payment deadlines.</li>
  <li><strong>Vendor Sourcing & Comparison</strong>: Columns for vendor, service, quote, contact, pros/cons, decisions.</li>
  <li><strong>Run-of-Show & Day-of Logistics</strong>: Hour-by-hour schedule, contacts, cues, setup checklist.</li>
</ol><h3>Step 2: Format With Usability in Mind</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Use checkboxes for to-dos, dropdowns for statuses (e.g. “Not started / In progress / Done”).</li>
  <li>Freeze header rows so they stay visible during scrolling.</li>
  <li>Set conditional color rules (e.g. past deadlines turn red, paid items show green).</li>
</ul><h3>Step 3: Link Between Sheets</h3>
<p>Use formula cross‑sheet references: automatically roll up RSVP totals, budget sums, or key milestone status on your main dashboard.</p><h3>Step 4: Create a Companion Docs Checklist</h3>
<p>Use Google Docs to craft a printable checklist version—ideal for sharing with volunteers, catering teams, or venue staff. Structure it by phase (preparation, on‑site, wrap‑up).</p><h2>Sample Structure Outline</h2>
<h3>Dashboard Sheet</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Priority summary (e.g. 3 must‑haves)</li>
  <li>Progress overview (tasks complete / total)</li>
  <li>Upcoming deadlines next 30 days</li>
</ul><h3>Timeline Sheet</h3>

  <li>Column A: Date or week</li>

<p>Use Google Docs for clear, printable checklists. Create a companion checklist document that mirrors your Sheets tasks—great for onsite staff or as a printable reference.</p>

<p>Open <strong>Google Sheets → Template Gallery → Wedding planner</strong> or just search in your Drive templates folder as cited by Reddit users .</p>

<meta name="keywords" content="affiliate disclosure statement template, sample affiliate disclosure, FTC compliant disclosure"><p>If you include affiliate links on your website or in your content, you need a clear statement telling readers that you may earn commissions on purchases made through those links. This guide gives you easy-to-use templates, placement tips, and answers real questions people ask—so you're transparent, trust‑worthy, and compliant.</p><h2>Why You Need an Affiliate Disclosure</h2>
<p>A disclosure protects both you and your readers. By being transparent about your financial relationship with recommended products, you build trust and stay compliant with authorities like the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or Amazon Associates Program.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Builds trust:</strong> Readers know you’re honest about commissions.</li>
  <li><strong>Legal requirement:</strong> FTC rules require that disclosures be “clear and conspicuous.”</li>
  <li><strong>Program compliance:</strong> Amazon’s terms mandate the exact language where relevant: “As an Amazon Associate, I earn from qualifying purchases."</li>
</ul><h2>Where to Place Your Disclosure</h2>
<p>The disclosure must be visible and close to affiliate links:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Place it at the top of any page or section containing affiliate links—above the fold if possible.</li>
  <li>Include a shorter inline disclosure just before or after each affiliate link.</li>
  <li>Add it to site‑wide elements like header, sidebar, or footer—but never rely on a footer alone.</li>
</ul><h2>Template Variations You Can Copy and Customize</h2>
<p>Choose the template that matches your tone or platform:</p>
<h3>Template: Simple and Direct (≈2 sentences)</h3>
<p><strong>“This post contains affiliate links. If you make a purchase through these links, I may earn a commission at no additional cost to you.”</strong></p><h3>Template: Friendly and Conversational (for casual blogs or social media)</h3>
<p><strong>“Hey! Some links in this post are affiliate links, which means I may earn a small commission if you buy—at no extra cost to you. Thanks for your support!”</strong></p><h3>Template: Formal/Professional (for finance, tech, or business niches)</h3>
<p><strong>“Disclosure: This post includes affiliate links. I may receive compensation if you purchase via these links.”</strong></p><h3>Template: Amazon-Specific (meets Amazon Associates requirement)</h3>
<p><strong>“As an Amazon Associate, I earn from qualifying purchases.”</strong></p>
<p>Optionally combine with context: “This post contains affiliate links. As an Amazon Associate, I earn from qualifying purchases.” </p><h2>Examples from Authoritative Sites</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Wirecutter:</strong> Disclosure at top of product review pages, plus a link to a detailed policy page.</li>
  <li><strong>Young House Love</strong> uses language like “affiliate links” in introductions and repeats disclosures in multiple site spots.</li>
  <li><strong>CryptoVantage</strong> includes an affiliate disclosure at the bottom of long‑form content and pairs it with a risk disclaimer.</li>
</ul><h2>Practical Placement Ideas</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Blog posts:</strong> Disclosure under the title or just above the first affiliate links.</li>
  <li><strong>Emails &amp; newsletters:</strong> If affiliate links are included, note the commission relationship at or before the link.</li>
  <li><strong>Social media:</strong> Use #ad or #affiliate hashtags in your caption or description and include a short written disclosure.</li>
  <li><strong>YouTube or videos:</strong> Verbally disclose inside the video, plus in the description text. </li>
</ul><h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3>Q: Do I need a disclosure for every affiliate link?</h3>
<p>A: Yes. Every page or post with affiliate links must have its own disclosure—even if you have a general site‑wide disclosure.</p><h3>Q: Can I just put a symbol or asterisk instead of writing a statement?</h3>
<p>A: No. FTC and many affiliate programs require full wording like “affiliate links” or “I earn commissions.” Symbols aren’t enough.</p><h3>Q: How do requirements differ internationally?</h3>
<p>A: The FTC’s rules apply if you’re targeting U.S. consumers. Other countries like Canada, UK, and EU have similar transparency laws—so disclosure is a global best practice.</p><h3>Q: Do I need to disclose affiliate emails?</h3>
<p>A: Yes. If you include affiliate links in emails, be clear that they may result in commission—via a short statement before the link or at top of the email. 13</p><h3>Q: How should I format the disclosure so it's noticeable?</h3>
<p>A: Use a readable font size and color. Avoid tiny text or blending it into your site design. Make it look like part of the content—not hidden.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Choose a template that fits your tone, place your disclosure near affiliate links, and keep it short, clear, and honest. That way, your audience feels respected—and you stay compliant with program rules and legal standards.</p>
<p><strong>Action step:</strong> Pick one of the templates above, add it to your site and each post with affiliate links, and review it on mobile. Need a make‑your‑own version or an internal style guide? Reach out—we can customize one for your brand.</p><!--

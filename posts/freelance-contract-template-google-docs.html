</ul>  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>  <h3>Q: Are freelance contract templates free?</h3>  
<p>A: Yes. Platforms like TheGoodocs, ManyRequests, ClickUp, Portant, and DocsAutomator offer free Google Docs templates you can copy and customize instantly.</p>  <h3>Q: Do I need legal review?</h3>  
<p>A: While templates offer structure, you may want legal counsel—especially if you have specific risk concerns or operate in regulated industries.</p>  <h3>Q: What’s the difference between scope and deliverables?</h3>  
<p>A: Deliverables are the concrete outputs (e.g., a logo, a draft). Scope includes the broader context—objectives, milestones, timelines, and exclusions.</p>  <h3>Q: Should IP ownership stay with the freelancer or client?</h3>  
<p>A: That depends on negotiation. Some freelancers retain copyright and grant the client limited licenses; others assign rights upon payment. Make that clear in the document.</p>  <h3>Q: Can multiple clients share the same Docs template?</h3>  
<p>A: You should make a copy per client to preserve customized terms and avoid overwriting.</p>  <h3>Q: How do I sign digitally?</h3>  
<p>A: You can export the completed contract as PDF and use tools like DocuSign, Adobe Sign, or smaller e‑signature tools. Some automated platforms support built‑in signing flows.</p>  <h2>Conclusion</h2>  
<p>A Google Docs freelance contract template is a powerful starting point for clear, enforceable client work agreements. Whether you choose a basic blank, a guided template, or an automated system, make sure your document includes all key sections: parties, scope, payment, IP, confidentiality, termination, and signatures. Customize carefully, review legal considerations, and treat every signed contract as a lasting record.</p>

Google Docs offers a free, cloud-based alternative to expensive software, and when used right, it can become your ultimate self-publishing ally.</p><h2>Why Use Google Docs for Your eBook?</h2>
<p>Google Docs offers a low-barrier, high-flexibility tool for self-publishing. Whether you're launching a lead magnet, creating a digital product, or writing your first book for Amazon Kindle, here’s why Google Docs stands out:</p><ul>
  <li><strong>Cloud-based collaboration:</strong> Edit and co-author with ease, anywhere.</li>
  <li><strong>Auto-save and revision history:</strong> Never lose a draft.</li>
  <li><strong>Template accessibility:</strong> Easily replicate or modify book layouts.</li>
  <li><strong>Export versatility:</strong> Save as PDF, EPUB, or Word — all free.</li>
</ul><h2>Elements of a Professional eBook Template</h2>
<p>Before diving into Google Docs, understand the structural elements of a polished eBook:</p><h3>1. Cover Page</h3>
<p>Your cover is your first impression. Include the title, subtitle, author name, and optional graphic. Use <strong>center alignment</strong> and bold typography.</p><h3>2. Table of Contents</h3>
<p>Insert an automated table using Google Docs' "Table of contents" tool. Make sure each chapter uses proper heading tags like <strong>Heading 1</strong> for automatic generation.</p><h3>3. Introduction or Preface</h3>
<p>Set expectations. This is where you state the book's purpose and your authority on the subject.</p><h3>4. Chapters (Body Content)</h3>
<p>Each chapter should start on a new page. Use <strong>Heading 1</strong> for titles, <strong>Heading 2</strong> for subtopics, and format body text in a clean, legible font like Georgia or Times New Roman (12 pt).</p><h3>5. Call-to-Actions</h3>
<p>Encourage readers to subscribe, leave reviews, or explore your courses or website. CTAs should be persuasive but not intrusive.</p><h3>6. About the Author</h3>
<p>Include a brief biography, credentials, and links to your site or social media (anchor text only).</p><h3>7. Copyright and Legal Notices</h3>
<p>Protect your content with a simple copyright notice. Example: “© 2025 by [Author Name]. All rights reserved.”</p><h2>Creating Your eBook Template in Google Docs</h2>
<p>Let’s build your eBook from the ground up inside Google Docs:</p><h3>Step 1: Set Up Page Formatting</h3>
<p>Go to <strong>File → Page Setup</strong> and select the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Paper size: Letter or A4</li>
  <li>Orientation: Portrait</li>
  <li>Margins: 1 inch on all sides</li>

<p>After the cover and before your first chapter, insert a TOC from <strong>Insert → Table of contents</strong>. Choose with or without links, depending on your final format.</p><h3>Step 4: Add Page Breaks</h3>

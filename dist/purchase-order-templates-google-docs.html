This guide gives you a free, small-store-ready layout you can paste into Google Docs, plus practical steps to brand it, number it, and send it to suppliers in minutes.</p><h2>What a Purchase Order Is (and Why Small Stores Should Use One)</h2>
<p>A purchase order is a buyer-issued document that spells out exactly what you’re ordering—items, quantities, prices, and terms. For a small store, it’s the difference between “I thought we agreed” and “Here’s precisely what we approved.” Clear POs reduce disputes, help you reorder the right SKUs on time, and make bookkeeping faster.</p><h3>PO vs. invoice: the practical difference for daily shop ops</h3>
<p>Think of a <strong>purchase order</strong> as your shop’s official request to buy; it originates from you (the buyer). An <strong>invoice</strong> is your supplier’s bill to you. In day-to-day retail, you’ll create the PO before goods ship, and you’ll receive the invoice after the supplier fulfills and bills for the order.</p><h3>When a PO becomes legally binding</h3>
<p>Issuing a PO alone doesn’t usually form a contract; the agreement is formed when the seller accepts and confirms the order and terms. Keep that in mind when you email the PO: ask the vendor to confirm acceptance (or provide their order acknowledgment) so both sides share the same details.</p><h3>Benefits for small retailers: stock control, budgeting, and fewer disputes</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Inventory control:</strong> Track what’s on order vs. what’s on hand.</li>
  <li><strong>Cost clarity:</strong> Lock pricing per SKU and spot overbilling quickly.</li>
  <li><strong>Faster month-end:</strong> Matching PO ↔ invoice ↔ packing slip speeds reconciliation.</li>
  <li><strong>Vendor trust:</strong> Professional documents get prioritized and reduce back-and-forth.</li>
</ul><h2>Google Docs vs. Google Sheets for Purchase Orders</h2>
<p>Both work; the right choice depends on how you operate today.</p><h3>Which one to choose (quick decision table)</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Choose Google Docs</strong> if you want a polished, printable form that mirrors a letterhead—great for emailing as PDF to suppliers and for occasional ordering.</li>
  <li><strong>Choose Google Sheets</strong> if you want calculations (line totals, tax, discounts) and plan to pull items from a product catalog frequently.</li>
  <li><strong>Best of both:</strong> Store items and vendors in Sheets, then merge into a Docs template for perfect-looking POs.</li>
</ul><h3>When to pair Docs + Sheets (mail-merge for speed and accuracy)</h3>
<p>A lightweight setup: keep a “Catalog” sheet (SKU, description, price) and a “PO Log” (PO No., vendor, date, totals). Use a Docs template with placeholders like <strong>{PO_NUMBER}</strong>, <strong>{VENDOR_NAME}</strong>, and <strong>{ITEMS_TABLE}</strong>. Merge, export to PDF, and email in one go—no heavy systems required.</p><h2>The Essential Fields Your Small-Store PO Must Include</h2>
<p>Include these every time so vendors can fulfill without follow-ups:</p><h3>Header elements: PO number, dates, buyer/seller, payment &amp; delivery terms</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>PO Number</strong> (unique and sequential)</li>
  <li><strong>PO Date</strong> + <strong>Expected Delivery Date</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Buyer (Your Store) Details:</strong> name, address, phone, email</li>
  <li><strong>Supplier Details:</strong> company, contact, phone, email</li>
  <li><strong>Ship-To Location:</strong> store or warehouse address</li>
  <li><strong>Payment Terms:</strong> e.g., Net 30, deposits if applicable</li>
  <li><strong>Delivery Terms:</strong> shipping method, freight responsibility, cut-off times</li>
</ul><h3>Line items: SKU, description, qty, unit price, discounts, tax, totals</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>SKU</strong> (your internal or supplier part number)</li>
  <li><strong>Description</strong> (size, color, variant)</li>
  <li><strong>Qty Ordered</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Unit Price</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Line Total</strong> (Qty × Unit)</li>
  <li><strong>Discount</strong> (if any)</li>
  <li><strong>Tax</strong> (if applicable)</li>
  <li><strong>Subtotal, Tax, Shipping, Grand Total</strong></li>
</ul><h3>Footer safeguards: approvals, notes, returns, and receiving checklist</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Approval:</strong> space for preparer/approver names or initials</li>
  <li><strong>Notes:</strong> substitutions, lead times, backorder policy</li>
  <li><strong>Receiving Checklist:</strong> “Received by,” date, condition, discrepancies</li>
  <li><strong>Attachments:</strong> include catalog screenshots or quotes if needed</li>
</ul><h2>Build the Template in Google Docs (Step-by-Step)</h2><h3>Page setup, margins, and brand styling</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Open Google Docs &rarr; <strong>Blank</strong>. Set <strong>File &gt; Page setup</strong> to 1" margins (or your letterhead norms). Update orientation/size if needed.</li>
  <li>Add your logo at the top left (<strong>Insert &gt; Image</strong>). Type your store name, address, phone, and email beneath.</li>
  <li>Apply clean styles: make the store name bold, 14–16 pt; body 11–12 pt; headings 12–14 pt. Keep it printer-friendly.</li>
</ol><h3>Insert a clean, printer-friendly items table</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Insert a two-column header table for buyer and supplier details. Row 1 cells: <em>Buyer (Your Store)</em> and <em>Supplier</em>.</li>
  <li>Below, insert a three-column table for PO metadata: <em>PO Number</em>, <em>PO Date</em>, <em>Expected Delivery</em>. Add a fourth cell for <em>Payment Terms</em> if you prefer.</li>
  <li>Insert your line-item table, e.g., 7 columns: <em>SKU</em>, <em>Description</em>, <em>Qty</em>, <em>Unit</em>, <em>Discount</em>, <em>Tax</em>, <em>Line Total</em>. Make the header row bold and consider repeating it on each page if the table runs long.</li>
  <li>Add a summary table with <em>Subtotal, Tax, Shipping, Grand Total</em>.</li>
  <li>Finish with a single-cell note area (substitutions, backorders) and a small receiving section (Received by / Date / Condition / Notes).</li>
</ol><h3>Add automatic PO numbering conventions (simple, robust patterns)</h3>
<p>Pick a scheme that sorts well and never collides. For example:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>YYMM-NNNN:</strong> e.g., 2508-0042 for your 42nd PO in Aug 2025</li>
  <li><strong>STORE-YY-NNNN:</strong> includes store code if you have multiple locations</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep a simple log in a Google Sheet with columns: <em>PO Number</em>, <em>Date</em>, <em>Vendor</em>, <em>Total</em>, <em>Status</em> (Draft/Sent/Received/Closed). This prevents duplicates and helps audits later.</p><h3>Save as a reusable small-store template</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Replace real values with placeholders (e.g., <strong>{VENDOR_NAME}</strong>, <strong>{SHIP_TO}</strong>, <strong>{PAYMENT_TERMS}</strong>).</li>
  <li>Click the title and rename your file to <strong>PO Template – Small Store</strong>.</li>
  <li>When you need a new PO, open the template and choose <strong>File &gt; Make a copy</strong>. Fill, export to PDF, and email.</li>
</ol><h2>Optional Pro Move: Generate POs from a Google Sheet (No-Code Mail-Merge)</h2><h3>Prepare the Sheet (catalog + PO log) and the Docs template placeholders</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Create a <strong>Catalog</strong> sheet: SKU, Description, Unit, Price, Supplier.</li>
  <li>Create a <strong>PO Log</strong> sheet: PO Number, Vendor, PO Date, Expected Delivery, Subtotal, Tax, Shipping, Total, Status.</li>
  <li>In your Docs template, wrap every dynamic field with braces: <strong>{PO_NUMBER}</strong>, <strong>{PO_DATE}</strong>, <strong>{VENDOR_NAME}</strong>, etc.</li>
</ol><h3>Merge options: add-on or simple tool</h3>
<p>Use a Sheets-to-Docs merge add-on (several free options exist) or a simple automation service. Map columns from your PO Log to the Docs placeholders. For line items, either generate a table in the merged Doc or paste from the Sheet after filtering by PO number. This keeps formatting tidy without writing code.</p><h3>Export, e-sign, and email to vendors</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Once merged, <strong>File &gt; Download &gt; PDF</strong> for a locked copy.</li>
  <li>If you need signatures, send through your preferred e-signature tool or request a vendor acknowledgment email referencing the PO number and totals.</li>
  <li>Email the PDF to the vendor’s order inbox and CC your store mailbox for records.</li>
</ol><h2>Operating the PO Process in a Small Shop</h2><h3>A lightweight approval flow that actually happens</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Draft:</strong> Clerk prepares the PO in Docs using the template.</li>
  <li><strong>Approve:</strong> Manager checks price, terms, and totals; initials the footer.</li>
  <li><strong>Send:</strong> PDF emailed to vendor; status in the PO Log moves to <em>Sent</em>.</li>
  <li><strong>Receive:</strong> Staff verifies quantity/condition against the PO; update status to <em>Received</em>.</li>
  <li><strong>Close:</strong> After the invoice matches and is paid, mark <em>Closed</em>.</li>
</ul><h3>Receiving &amp; three-way match (PO ↔ invoice ↔ packing slip)</h3>
<p>When goods arrive, compare the packing slip to your PO lines—check SKU, quantities, and unit prices. Note any damages or shortages. When the invoice arrives, confirm it matches the PO and what you actually received. Only then approve payment. This one routine eliminates most billing surprises for small stores.</p><h3>Common mistakes to avoid (and how to fix them fast)</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Missing PO number:</strong> Vendors can’t reference your order; always assign before sending.</li>
  <li><strong>Unclear terms:</strong> If you need split deliveries, cut-off times, or “no substitutions,” write it in the notes.</li>
  <li><strong>SKU mismatches:</strong> Include both your SKU and the supplier’s part # to avoid wrong picks.</li>
  <li><strong>No receiving check:</strong> A 30-second checklist prevents paying for items you didn’t get.</li>

<p>––––– copy ends –––––</p><h3>Instructions to duplicate and customize</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Paste the layout into a new Google Doc.</li>
  <li>Replace placeholders with real data or leave them to use as a template.</li>
  <li>Go to <strong>File &gt; Make a copy</strong> for each new PO; export to PDF to send.</li>
</ol><h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><h3>Q: Is a purchase order the same as an invoice?</h3>
<p>A: No. A PO is your request to buy (buyer → seller). An invoice is the supplier’s bill to you after fulfilling the order.</p><h3>Q: How should I number purchase orders?</h3>
<p>A: Use a sortable, unique format like <strong>YYMM-NNNN</strong> (e.g., 2508-0042). Keep a PO Log in Sheets to avoid duplicates and track status.</p><h3>Q: Should I use Google Docs or Google Sheets?</h3>
<p>A: Use Docs for polished PDFs and simple orders; use Sheets for calculations and catalogs. Many small stores use <em>Sheets for data</em> and <em>Docs for the final PO</em>.</p><h3>Q: What’s the fastest way to email a PO?</h3>
<p>A: Export the Doc as PDF, attach it to an email to your vendor’s order address, and CC your store mailbox. Ask for written acknowledgment referencing your PO number.</p><h3>Q: What fields are absolutely required?</h3>
<p>A: PO number, dates, buyer/supplier info, ship-to address, clear line items (SKU, qty, price), totals, and payment/delivery terms.</p><h3>Q: How do I prevent overbilling?</h3>
<p>A: Do a quick three-way match: compare the invoice to your PO and the packing slip or what you received. Only approve payment if they align.</p><h3>Q: Can I add signatures?</h3>
<p>A: Yes—either initial the approval area before sending, or use an e-signature tool. Vendors can also confirm acceptance via a formal acknowledgment email.</p><p><strong>Wrap-up:</strong> You now have a clear, small-store-ready purchase order template plus a simple process to create, send, and track orders. Save this as your store’s standard, and your next reorder will take minutes—not hours.</p><!--

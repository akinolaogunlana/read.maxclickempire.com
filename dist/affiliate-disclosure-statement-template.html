This guide supplies plain-language templates, exact placement rules for Blogger, and ready-to-use snippets for posts, social, and email.</p><p>Inside: short and long disclosure templates you can copy, where to place them (so they’re legally "conspicuous"), platform-specific examples (Amazon, YouTube, Instagram), and quick implementation steps for Blogger so you can add a reusable disclosure in minutes.</p><h2>Why an affiliate disclosure matters</h2><p>Affiliate disclosures protect both your readers and your site. They tell users you may earn a commission when they buy through links on your site; that transparency builds trust and keeps you on the right side of regulators. In the U.S., the FTC’s Endorsement Guides require clear and conspicuous disclosures whenever there is a material connection. </p><p>Beyond legality, disclosures reduce surprise and increase credibility. Sites that hide or bury affiliate relationships see more skeptical readers and a higher bounce rate. Industry guides and legal resources recommend placing disclosures where a typical reader will notice them without hunting. </p><h2>Core rules you must follow (quick summary)</h2><p><strong>Make the disclosure clear and conspicuous.</strong> Use simple language a typical reader will understand (e.g., “I earn a commission if you buy through links on this page”). Avoid vague legalese that hides the point. </p><p><strong>Put disclosures close to the endorsement or link.</strong> A disclosure only in the site footer or policy page is a helpful backup but is not sufficient by itself. Place it near the first affiliate link or claim in a post or page. </p><p><strong>Repeat when necessary.</strong> If a long article contains many affiliate links or sections, repeat the disclosure where readers might change context (e.g., at the top of each product review or before a list of links).</p><h2>Ready-to-use templates (copy, paste, customize)</h2><h3>Short line for link-level disclosure (inline)</h3>
<p><strong>Template (one-line, link-level):</strong> I may earn a commission if you purchase through links on this page.</p><h3>Full paragraph for blog posts and reviews</h3>
<p><strong>Template (post-level):</strong> Some links on this page are affiliate links, which means I may receive a small commission if you buy through them, at no extra cost to you. I only recommend products I use or believe will help my readers. Read my full disclosure in the footer for details.</p><h3>Footer / site-wide disclosure template (backup)</h3>
<p><strong>Template (footer):</strong> Disclosure: This site uses affiliate links. If you click a link and purchase a product, I may earn a commission — this helps support the site and keeps content free.</p><h3>Social media / short-form post template</h3>
<p><strong>Template (Instagram / TikTok / Twitter):</strong> This post contains affiliate links. I may earn a commission if you buy through a link. #ad</p><h3>Email newsletter disclosure template</h3>
<p><strong>Template (email):</strong> This email contains affiliate links. If you click an affiliate link and make a purchase, we may earn a commission at no extra cost to you.</p><p>Use these templates as starting points — shorten the language for tight spaces (tweets) and expand for long-form posts. Platform-specific rules (for example, Amazon Associates) may require specific wording; always check the program terms. </p><h2>Where to place disclosures on your Blogger site (practical)</h2><h3>Per-post: above the first link / first product mention</h3>
<p>For reviews or posts with affiliate links, show the disclosure at the top of the article (first paragraph or immediately before the first affiliate link). This is the clearest way to ensure readers see it before clicking. The FTC emphasizes proximity to the endorsement. </p><h3>Link-level: parenthetical right after the link</h3>
<p>When space permits, add a short parenthetical after the link: (affiliate link) or (commission earned). This makes the relationship visible at the moment a reader sees the link.</p><h3>Site-wide footer: as backup only</h3>
<p>Include a footer disclosure and a linked full disclosure page (full details and a list of affiliate networks). But do not rely on the footer alone — courts and regulators look for disclosures readers actually see. </p><h3>In widgets / “related products” sections</h3>
<p>If you display affiliate products in a widget or sidebar, include a short disclosure text above the widget (e.g., “Sponsored / Affiliate links”). Make sure it’s visible on mobile as well.</p><h2>Platform-specific notes & examples</h2><h3>Amazon Associates disclosure wording</h3>
<p>Amazon’s program policies and many industry guides recommend explicit mention that you are an Amazon Associate and may earn from qualifying purchases. Include that language in your Amazon-related posts to meet both Amazon’s rules and FTC expectations. </p><h3>YouTube descriptions and on-video timing</h3>
<p>On YouTube, put a disclosure in the video description and make a clear spoken disclosure early in the video. Visual text alone in the description may not be sufficient; a brief spoken disclosure is recommended for accessibility and clarity. </p><h3>Instagram, TikTok and short-form posts</h3>
<p>Hashtags like #ad or #sponsored are commonly used, but they should be paired with clear language when possible (e.g., “I may earn a commission if you buy through links in my bio — #ad”). Make sure the disclosure is in the post itself (not only in the profile bio) when the post contains an affiliate link. </p><h3>Email newsletters and affiliate links</h3>
<p>Place the disclosure in the header or at the top of the email where readers can see it before clicking. If the email is a dedicated promotion, make the disclosure prominent and explicit.</p><h2>How to implement technical snippets in Blogger (step-by-step)</h2><h3>Adding disclosure to a post template</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Edit your Blogger post template (Layout → Theme → Edit HTML) and insert a placeholder variable near the post header where you want a default disclosure to appear.</li>
  <li>When writing a post, paste the post-level template at the top of the post body (before the first affiliate link).</li>
</ol><h3>Creating a reusable snippet (Blogger widget)</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Go to Layout → Add a Gadget → HTML/JavaScript.</li>
  <li>Paste your short disclosure text and give it a clear title (you can hide the title so only the disclosure shows).</li>
  <li>Place the widget in the relevant area (above posts or in the sidebar) and include a short inline disclosure per post as well.</li>
</ol><h3>Accessibility & mobile visibility tips</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Use readable font size and contrast for disclosures so they are visible on small screens.</li>
  <li>Keep the language simple (avoid technical legalese).</li>
  <li>Test on mobile and desktop to ensure the disclosure is visible without scrolling past major content when possible.</li>
</ul><h2>International & multi-jurisdiction considerations</h2><p>Different countries have varying disclosure expectations. The FTC covers the U.S., but other jurisdictions (UK, EU) also demand transparency. When you have an international audience, prefer plain-language disclosures and localize them when needed (e.g., translate or adjust phrasing for UK/EU readers). Always consult local regulations or a legal advisor for high-risk promotions. </p><h2>Common mistakes and how to fix them</h2><h3>Hidden disclosures (footer-only)</h3>
<p>Problem: Disclosure only in site footer or policy pages where readers don’t see it. Fix: Add per-post or link-level disclosures in addition to footer copy. </p><h3>Ambiguous phrasing</h3>
<p>Problem: Vague wording like “I may receive compensation” without context. Fix: Say what the compensation is tied to (clicks/purchases) and that it does not increase the user’s price.</p><h3>Over-reliance on hashtags</h3>
<p>Problem: Using only #ad or #affiliate where context is limited. Fix: Combine a short clear phrase with a hashtag (e.g., “This post contains affiliate links — I may earn a commission. #ad”). </p><h2>Examples (good vs bad)</h2><h3>Inline link example (good)</h3>
<p>“Product X is a great budget option. <a href="#">Buy Product X (affiliate link)</a>. I may earn a commission if you purchase through this link.”</p><h3>Footer-only example (bad)</h3>
<p>“Disclosure: See footer.” — this is not sufficient on its own because readers clicking a link from the article may not notice the footer statement.</p><h3>Social example (good + bad)</h3>
<p>Good: “Check my review of Product Y — I may earn a small commission if you buy using links in my bio. #ad”</p>
<p>Bad: “Promo code below” with no explicit mention of commission or affiliate relationship.</p><h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><h3>Q: Do I need a disclosure for every affiliate program?</h3>
<p>A: Yes — whenever you have a material connection (earned commission, free product, paid promotion) you should disclose it. The requirement applies regardless of program size. </p><h3>Q: Is “#ad” enough on Instagram?</h3>
<p>A: A visible #ad can be acceptable, but for clarity add a short phrase like “This post contains affiliate links” when space allows. Avoid relying solely on buried hashtags. </p><h3>Q: Where should I put disclosures on Blogger?</h3>
<p>A: Add a short disclosure at the top of each post that contains affiliate links, use link-level parentheticals after each affiliate link if possible, and include a site-wide footer disclosure as backup.</p><h3>Q: Do I need different wording for Amazon or other networks?</h3>
<p>A: Some networks (Amazon Associates, etc.) include required or recommended disclosure language. Use the network’s example wording plus your standard disclosure to satisfy both program and legal expectations. </p><h3>Q: Will adding a disclosure hurt conversions?</h3>
<p>A: Transparent disclosures might slightly affect some readers, but they build trust and reduce complaints or takedowns — long-term trust generally improves conversion health.</p><h2>Conclusion & quick checklist</h2><p>Placing clear, conspicuous affiliate disclosures is both a legal requirement and a best practice. Use a short inline disclosure for links, a post-level paragraph for long-form content, and a footer page for full details. Localize the wording for different platforms and jurisdictions and test visibility on mobile.</p><p><strong>Quick checklist:</strong></p>

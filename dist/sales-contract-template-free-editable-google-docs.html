</ul><p><strong>How to use</strong>: Open the template, click <strong>File &gt; Make a copy</strong>, and replace bracketed placeholders. Keep a versioned filename (e.g., <em>Sales-Contract_ACME_2025-08-18_v1</em>). Share in <strong>View</strong> mode while negotiating, then switch to <strong>Suggesting</strong> mode for tracked edits before final sign-off.</p><h2>Quick-Start: Customize the Template in Google Docs (7 Steps)</h2>
<h3>1) Identify the transaction type</h3>
<p>Tick “<strong>Goods</strong>” if you’re transferring title to items; tick “<strong>Services</strong>” if you’re providing labor or deliverables. If both, keep sections for each (e.g., hardware + installation). This ensures you only keep relevant clauses like “risk of loss” for goods or “intellectual property” for services.</p><h3>2) Write a tight scope that survives disputes</h3>
<p>Use bullets. For goods: model, SKU, specs, quantity, standards, serials. For services: activities, deliverables, formats, acceptance criteria, and what’s explicitly <em>not</em> included. Add a change-order rule: “Out-of-scope items require a written change request with a revised timeline and price.”</p><h3>3) Price &amp; payment triggers that match cash flow</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Goods</strong>: 40% deposit on order, 60% on delivery/acceptance.</li>
  <li><strong>Services</strong> (fixed fee): 40% on signing, 40% on first draft, 20% on final acceptance.</li>
  <li><strong>Time &amp; materials</strong>: monthly invoicing, net-15 or net-30; include a cap if the client needs predictability.</li>
</ul>
<p>State late fees (e.g., “1.5% per month or the maximum allowed by law”), and whether you pause services if invoices go overdue by more than X days.</p><h3>4) Delivery &amp; acceptance that prevent endless rework</h3>
<p>Set delivery dates, hand-off method (email, drive link, logistics carrier), and an <strong>acceptance window</strong> (e.g., 5–10 business days). If no written rejection with specific reasons arrives in that window, the item is deemed accepted.</p><h3>5) Warranties &amp; disclaimers that are fair</h3>
<p>For goods: warranty period (e.g., 90 days), remedies (repair/replace/refund). For services: workmanship warranty tied to the agreed scope. Include a sensible disclaimer (e.g., “no implied warranties of fitness/merchantability beyond the express terms”), then a limitation of liability (e.g., capped at fees paid in the last 12 months), excluding willful misconduct.</p><h3>6) Ownership: title (goods) or IP (services)</h3>
<p>Goods: specify when <strong>title and risk</strong> pass (e.g., upon delivery to carrier vs. upon client receipt). Services: define IP ownership—client owns final deliverables upon full payment; vendor retains tools, methods, and pre-existing IP with a license to use if needed.</p><h3>7) Sign cleanly: e-sign or wet ink</h3>
<p>Your signature block should work with typed names, dates, and job titles, plus an e-signature image. Google Docs plays nicely with common e-signature tools; keep your document as a locked PDF after execution.</p><h2>Essential Clauses (Copy-Ready Language)</h2>
<h3>Payment &amp; Late Fees</h3>
<p><em>“Invoices are due net-15 from the invoice date. Past-due balances accrue a late fee of 1.5% per month (or the maximum permitted by law), compounded monthly. Provider may suspend performance after 10 days’ written notice if amounts remain past due.”</em></p><h3>Change Requests</h3>
<p><em>“Client may request out-of-scope work via written change request. Provider will reply with adjusted fees and schedule. No changes are effective until both parties sign the change request.”</em></p><h3>Confidentiality &amp; Reviews</h3>
<p><em>“Neither party will disclose the other’s non-public information except as required to perform this Agreement. Nothing herein prohibits any person from leaving honest reviews, ratings, or feedback about a party’s goods or services.”</em> (Prevents illegal “no negative review” clauses.)</p><h3>Warranties</h3>
<p><em>“Provider warrants that goods will materially conform to the specifications on delivery and services will be performed in a professional and workmanlike manner. Exclusive remedies are repair, replacement, re-performance, or refund.”</em></p><h3>Limitation of Liability</h3>
<p><em>“Except for willful misconduct or infringement indemnity, neither party is liable for indirect or consequential damages. Aggregate liability is capped at the total fees paid under this Agreement in the 12 months preceding the claim.”</em></p><h3>Governing Law &amp; Venue</h3>
<p><em>“This Agreement is governed by the laws of [State/Country], without regard to conflicts of law. Courts located in [County/State] have exclusive jurisdiction.”</em></p><h2>Google Docs Power-Use: Faster, Safer Contracting</h2>
<h3>Use placeholders and fields</h3>
<p>Bracketed fields like <em>[Effective Date]</em>, <em>[Client Legal Name]</em>, <em>[Governing Law]</em> keep drafting fast and reduce errors. Keep a definitions table at the top for legal names and addresses.</p><h3>Suggesting mode for redlines</h3>
<p>Switch to <strong>Suggesting</strong> to track every negotiation change. Add a short “Changes Log” section at the end with date, editor, and summary so non-lawyers can scan what actually shifted.</p><h3>Protect your version of record</h3>
<p>When signed, <strong>File &gt; Download &gt; PDF</strong>, and store in a shared, read-only folder named <em>Executed-Contracts</em> with the counterparty name and date. Keep the Google Doc locked for audit, but treat the PDF as the official version.</p><h2>Goods vs. Services: What Actually Changes</h2>
<h3>For Goods (UCC-style structure)</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Identification</strong>: SKU/specs, quantity, quality standard.</li>
  <li><strong>Risk of loss</strong>: when it passes (carrier vs. receipt).</li>
  <li><strong>Inspection/acceptance</strong>: time window and criteria.</li>
  <li><strong>Warranties</strong>: duration, exclusions, and remedies.</li>
  <li><strong>Delivery terms</strong>: Incoterms or domestic shipping method.</li>
</ul><h3>For Services</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Deliverables</strong>: formats, milestones, review cycles.</li>
  <li><strong>IP ownership</strong>: who owns final work vs. underlying tools.</li>
  <li><strong>Client dependencies</strong>: access, data, approvals, materials.</li>
  <li><strong>Service windows</strong>: availability, response times if relevant.</li>
</ul><h2>Pro Tips from the Field</h2>
<h3>Show your math on price changes</h3>
<p>If input costs fluctuate, include an index-based adjustment (e.g., “price may be adjusted quarterly based on [index] with 30 days’ notice, capped at X% per year”). It’s fair and predictable.</p><h3>Set a single email for notices</h3>
<p>“Notices to: <em>legal@company.com</em>” saves deals when people change jobs or leave. Add a backup notice address to avoid missed deadlines.</p><h3>Make acceptance a two-step check</h3>
<p>For complex deliveries, use a short acceptance test list the client must initial. It squashes “but it didn’t…” arguments later.</p><h3>Don’t overreach on reviews</h3>
<p>Ban confidentiality breaches and defamation, yes—but don’t try to bar truthful reviews or assign review copyrights from customers. That can violate review-fairness laws and backfire.</p><h2>Mini-Guide: Bill of Sale vs. Sales Contract (Know the Difference)</h2>
<p><strong>Sales contract</strong> = the <em>agreement before</em> the exchange, setting terms (price, delivery, warranties). <strong>Bill of sale</strong> = the <em>receipt after</em> the exchange proving title transfer. Many transactions use both: the contract governs; the bill of sale confirms completion.</p><h2>Editable Google Docs Template — Core Structure</h2>
<h3>1. Parties &amp; Effective Date</h3>
<p>[Seller Legal Name], [Entity Type, State/Number], address; and [Buyer Legal Name], address. Effective date and reference number.</p><h3>2. Definitions</h3>
<p>Define “Goods,” “Services,” “Deliverables,” “Acceptance,” “Confidential Information,” “Change Request.”</p><h3>3. Scope</h3>
<p>Goods: specs, quantity, standards. Services: tasks, deliverables, acceptance tests. Out-of-scope list and change-order workflow.</p><h3>4. Fees &amp; Payment</h3>
<p>Price schedule, taxes, expenses (pre-approved), invoicing cadence, late fees, suspension rights.</p><h3>5. Delivery/Performance &amp; Acceptance</h3>
<p>Delivery method, dates, inspection window, acceptance or punch-list remedy.</p><h3>6. Warranties</h3>
<p>Goods: conformity + duration. Services: professional standard. Exclusions and remedy.</p><h3>7. Title &amp; Risk (Goods) / IP (Services)</h3>
<p>When title/risk pass (goods). Ownership of deliverables vs. tools (services).</p><h3>8. Confidentiality</h3>
<p>Mutual NDA-style language with review-fairness carve-out.</p><h3>9. Term &amp; Termination</h3>
<p>Term length, breach cure period, convenience termination (optional), and effect of termination.</p><h3>10. Liability &amp; Indemnity</h3>
<p>Cap, exclusions, third-party IP indemnity if applicable.</p><h3>11. Dispute Resolution</h3>
<p>Negotiation period → mediation → courts/arbitration (choose one). Venue, governing law.</p><h3>12. General</h3>
<p>Assignment, force majeure, notices, entire agreement, counterparts/e-signatures.</p><h3>13. Signatures</h3>
<p>Name, title, date, signature blocks (compatible with e-signature).</p><h2>Compliance &amp; Good-Citizen Clauses</h2>
<h3>Truthful marketing and lawful reviews</h3>
<p>Use simple language that promises only what you can deliver, and avoid any language that restricts customers from leaving honest feedback. That keeps you aligned with review-fairness rules and avoids headaches later.</p><h3>Clear product identity for goods</h3>
<p>When selling goods, explicitly identify what’s being sold and how it will be delivered. Precise identification helps with acceptance and remedies if something is off-spec.</p><h2>Worked Examples You Can Copy</h2>
<h3>Example A — Product sale (consumer electronics reseller)</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Scope</strong>: “25 units of Model ZX-410, 1TB, black, firmware v2.3 or later; includes cables; CE/FCC compliant.”</li>
  <li><strong>Delivery</strong>: “FOB Seller’s warehouse; carrier: DHL Express; insured.”</li>
  <li><strong>Acceptance</strong>: “Buyer has 7 business days to test. Report defects with serial numbers; Seller will replace within 10 business days.”</li>
  <li><strong>Price</strong>: “$24,750 total; 40% deposit on order; balance on delivery.”</li>
</ul><h3>Example B — Creative services (brand guidelines)</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Scope</strong>: “Brand toolkit PDF (40–60 pages), logo variants, color palette, typography rules, usage examples.”</li>
  <li><strong>Milestones</strong>: “Week 2: mood boards; Week 4: first draft; Week 6: final.”</li>
  <li><strong>Payment</strong>: “40/40/20 milestone billing; late fee 1.5%/month after 10 days overdue.”</li>
  <li><strong>IP</strong>: “Client owns final toolkit upon full payment; provider retains underlying tools and stock under original licenses.”</li>
</ul><h2>Red Flags to Remove Before You Send</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Vague scope (“deliver a website”) instead of deliverables (“10 pages, CMS, responsive, 3 rounds of revisions”).</li>
  <li>No acceptance window—leads to “perpetual draft” syndrome.</li>
  <li>Unlimited liability—uninsurable and risky for both parties.</li>
  <li>No late-fee or suspension rights—cash flow risk.</li>
  <li>Review-gag language—can violate review-fairness rules and damages trust.</li>
</ul><h2>How to Negotiate Without Stalling the Deal</h2>
<h3>Anchor on outcomes, not legalese</h3>
<p>Use acceptance criteria and a test checklist. It’s easier to agree to “passes A/B/C” than to argue abstract quality standards.</p><h3>Trade scope for time or money—explicitly</h3>
<p>If budget is tight, reduce deliverables (not quality), or extend the timeline. Document the trade in a one-page change order.</p><h3>Cap liability reasonably</h3>
<p>Link the cap to fees paid over the last 6–12 months. It’s common and fair for standard commercial work.</p><h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3>Q: What’s the difference between a sales contract and a bill of sale?</h3>
<p>A: The <strong>sales contract</strong> sets the terms before the exchange; the <strong>bill of sale</strong> is the receipt after transfer of ownership—many deals use both. </p><h3>Q: Is a Google Docs contract legally binding?</h3>
<p>A: Yes—what matters is mutual agreement and required elements (offer, acceptance, consideration, clear terms). You can draft and sign in Google Docs, then export to PDF; e-signatures are widely accepted when the parties consent to electronic signing and keep a reliable record.</p><h3>Q: What are the must-have clauses?</h3>
<p>A: Clear scope, price &amp; payment triggers, delivery/acceptance, warranties, IP or title/risk, confidentiality (with fair review language), limitation of liability, and governing law/venue.</p><h3>Q: Do I need different language for goods vs. services?</h3>
<p>A: Yes. Goods need title/risk and inspection language; services need IP ownership and acceptance criteria for deliverables.</p><h3>Q: Can I write my own contract or should I hire a lawyer?</h3>
<p>A: For straightforward deals, a vetted template saves time. For larger or specialized transactions, a short legal review is worth it—especially for liability, IP ownership, and compliance with your local laws.</p><h3>Q: What happens if a payment is late?</h3>
<p>A: Your contract should specify late fees and the right to pause work after notice. If the agreement is silent, you’ll have less leverage—include this upfront.</p><h3>Q: How do I handle scope creep?</h3>
<p>A: Keep a defined out-of-scope list and a simple change-request process (who requests, who approves, new price/timeline). No work starts until both parties sign the change.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Great contracts are plain, specific, and balanced. Use the Google Docs template above as your baseline, customize the scope and payment triggers to match your deal, and lock in a clear acceptance process. You’ll close faster, get paid on time, and reduce headaches over the life of the relationship.</p>

This guide gives mobile-first, copy-paste filters and exact menu taps so you can fix your inbox on the spot.</p><h2>Why blocking, reporting and filtering are different (and when to use each)</h2>\n<h3>What “block” does (goes to Spam)</h3>\n<p>When you block a sender in Gmail, future messages from that email address automatically go to the Spam folder. Blocking is best for repeat offenders from a single address, but it doesn’t permanently delete messages — it moves them to Spam so you can review them later. </p><h3>What “report spam” and filters do (account-level training & actions)</h3>\n<p>Reporting spam helps Google’s systems learn patterns and blocks similar messages for many users. Filters are the most durable solution: they let you create rules that archive, label, forward, or delete messages based on sender, subject, words, size, or other conditions — and filters operate account-side, so they apply whether you use the Gmail app or web interface.</p><h2>Quick actions — block, report, unsubscribe (mobile + desktop)</h2>\n<h3>Block a sender (step-by-step mobile & desktop steps)</h3>\n<p>Desktop: open the message → click the three-dot menu next to “Reply” → choose <strong>Block &quot;sender&quot;</strong>. Mobile (Gmail app): open the message → tap the three-dot overflow menu (top-right) → tap <strong>Block &quot;sender&quot;</strong>. Blocked mail goes to Spam. </p><h3>Report spam and phishing (when to use each)</h3>\n<p>Use <strong>Report spam</strong> for obvious junk and bulk senders; use <strong>Report phishing</strong> for suspicious messages that try to trick you into revealing passwords or clicking malicious links. Both actions improve filtering for your account and the broader Gmail user base. </p><h3>Use the unsubscribe button safely</h3>\n<p>If an email contains a legitimate unsubscribe link (often shown by Gmail at the top), use it to stop newsletters. Avoid clicking links in suspected phishing emails — instead, mark as spam or use a filter to remove them. For newsletters you still want but find noisy, create a filter to archive them automatically. </p><h2>Build durable filters to stop unwanted mail (exact examples)</h2>\n<h3>Create a delete filter (copyable filter settings)</h3>\n<p>Use these steps to auto-delete newsletters or repeat spam you don’t want to see:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Open Gmail (desktop recommended for filter creation) → Settings → See all settings → Filters and Blocked Addresses → Create a new filter.</li>\n  <li>In the “From” field, enter the problematic address or domain (example: <strong>@annoyingshop.com</strong> or <strong>spam-sender@example.com</strong>).</li>\n  <li>Click Search to preview matches, then choose <strong>Create filter</strong> and select <strong>Delete it</strong> (or <strong>Skip the Inbox (Archive it)</strong> if you want to keep a copy). Save the filter. </li>\n</ol><h3>Filter by domain, subject, or content (catch spoofing and newsletters)</h3>\n<p>To catch spoofed FROM addresses or newsletters that use many sender addresses, filter by subject or unique words in the message. Example filter patterns you can paste into the “Has the words” box:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>subject:(\\\"special offer\\\" OR \\\"order update\\\")</strong> — target messages with these phrases.</li>\n  <li><strong>from:(@example.com OR @shadyshop.net)</strong> — block whole domains.</li>\n  <li><strong>\\\"confirm your delivery\\\" -unsubscribe</strong> — catch common scam phrases while excluding messages that include an unsubscribe link.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Test filters with Search before you enable automatic deletion. Filters created on desktop apply across devices. </p><h2>Advanced techniques & Workspace admin controls</h2>\n<h3>Block or quarantine at domain level (Workspace Admin)</h3>\n<p>Workspace admins can set domain-level block rules and routing policies in the Admin console to quarantine or reject messages from specific senders or countries. If you manage a workspace and are seeing organization-wide spam, these controls are more effective than per-user blocks.</p><h3>Use Gmail’s routing/rules & spam reports (Enterprise)</h3>\n<p>Enterprises can use the security dashboard and spam filter reports to inspect patterns and build organization-wide protections. For most personal users, filters + blocking + reporting are sufficient. </p><h2>Troubleshooting — still getting mail after blocking? (common causes)</h2>\n<h3>Spoofed FROM addresses and why filters matter</h3>\n<p>Spammers sometimes forge the “From” header so a message appears to come from someone you blocked. In those cases blocking that visible sender won’t stop the forged messages. Use filters that match message body content, subject phrases, or the sending domain (or add rules to quarantine by DKIM/SPF failure if you’re a Workspace admin). Community threads show many users misunderstanding this and continuing to receive spoofed mail. </p><h3>Notifications, forwarding, and other synced devices (what to check)</h3>\n<p>If you still get notifications after blocking: check whether the messages are going to Spam (which usually suppresses notifications), verify if you have automatic forwarding or filters that forward new mail to another account, and check other apps (third-party mail apps may show mail differently). Also check that you haven’t set a label action that keeps mail visible. </p><h2>Safe third-party tools and what to avoid (privacy & OAuth scopes)</h2>\n<h3>Recommended tools and minimal-permission approach</h3>\n<p>Prefer tools that use limited OAuth scopes and clear privacy policies. Inbox-management apps that only request read-only access (and explicitly state they won’t modify mail) are preferable. Zapier and established services often provide integration options that are transparent about permissions. </p><h3>Tools to avoid and why (over-permissioned cleaners)</h3>\n<p>Avoid unknown “Gmail cleaner” or “inbox optimizer” apps that request full mailbox read/write permissions and broad scopes. These tools can access sensitive messages and may misuse data. When in doubt, use Gmail’s native features (block/report/filter) which are free and safe. </p><h2>Mobile walkthroughs — Android & iPhone (exact taps & menu text)</h2>\n<h3>Android step-by-step with screenshot suggestions (what to capture)</h3>\n<p>Android quick flow:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Open Gmail app → open unwanted message → tap three-dot menu (top-right) → tap <strong>Block &quot;sender&quot;</strong>.</li>\n  <li>If phishing: three-dot menu → <strong>Report phishing</strong> (or Report spam).</li>\n  <li>To create filters on mobile: it’s easier on desktop; if needed on mobile, open Gmail in a browser (desktop view) and follow the filter creation steps. Use the Google One or Gmail app to confirm blocked addresses later. </li>\n</ol><h3>iPhone step-by-step with keyboard tips (copy-paste filter text)</h3>\n<p>iPhone quick flow is similar: open message → tap three-dot menu → <strong>Block</strong> or <strong>Report</strong>. For filters, use desktop view via Safari/Chrome (Request Desktop Site) to create the persistent filters described earlier. Use copy/paste for exact domain or subject strings when building filters on desktop. </p><h2>Prevention & inbox hygiene habits (weekly checklist)</h2>\n<h3>Unsubscribe, archive, filter, and periodic audits</h3>\n<p>Weekly checklist:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Unsubscribe from newsletters you don’t read (use Gmail’s unsubscribe link where safe).</li>\n  <li>Block repeat offenders and report obvious spam.</li>\n  <li>Create filters for recurring promotional senders to auto-archive or delete.</li>\n  <li>Review Spam folder weekly for false positives and clear it.</li>\n</ul><h3>When to consider separate accounts or paid workspace controls</h3>\n<p>If you receive high volumes of important mail and want stronger protections (quarantine, routing, DKIM/SPF enforcement), consider Workspace plans or a dedicated work/personal separation. For most users, the free Gmail features plus filters are sufficient. </p><h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><h3>Q: How do I block an email address in Gmail on my phone?</h3>\n<p>A: Open the message in the Gmail app → tap the three-dot menu at the top right → choose <strong>Block &quot;sender&quot;</strong>. Future messages from that address will go to Spam. If you want messages deleted automatically, also create a filter on desktop that deletes messages from that address. </p><h3>Q: Why am I still getting emails after I blocked someone?</h3>\n<p>A: Blocked mail is moved to Spam — if the sender forges or spoofs the FROM header, blocking that visible address may not stop messages. Use filters that target subject lines or message content and report phishing if messages are malicious. Also check forwarding settings and other devices. </p><h3>Q: How can I block an entire domain (all addresses from example.com)?</h3>\n<p>A: Create a filter with <strong>From: @example.com</strong> in the Desktop filter creator, then choose <strong>Delete it</strong> as the action. Workspace admins can set domain-level blocks via the Admin console for organization-wide enforcement.</p><h3>Q: Is it safe to use third-party “Gmail cleaner” apps to mass-delete spam?</h3>\n<p>A: Only use reputable services that request minimal OAuth scopes and have transparent privacy policies. Avoid unknown apps that ask for full mailbox read/write access. When possible, use Gmail’s native filters and block/report tools instead. </p><h3>Q: What’s the best approach for phishing attempts?</h3>\n<p>A: Don’t click links or download attachments. Use <strong>Report phishing</strong> from the message menu, block the sender, and change passwords if you think credentials were exposed. Consider enabling 2-Step Verification and running Google’s Security Checkup. </p><h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Stop unwanted Gmail messages by combining immediate actions (block + report + unsubscribe) with durable solutions (filters and domain-level rules if needed). Mobile users should learn the quick taps, but create filters on desktop for the most reliable results. Start now: open a recent unwanted message, tap the three-dot menu, and either <strong>Block</strong> or <strong>Report</strong> — then create one filter that deletes or archives similar future messages.</p><p><strong>Call to action:</strong> Open Gmail on your phone and block one persistent sender now, then run a quick filter creation on desktop to stop the rest automatically.</p>\n\n<div class=\"related-articles\">\n  <h3>Related Articles</h3>\n  <ul>\n    <li><a href=\"/posts/gmail-storage-cleanup-drive-mobile.html\" title=\"Gmail Storage Full?

always one of a small set of problems — client sync, storage quota, filters/forwarding, account suspension or DNS/MX issues for custom domains. This guide walks you from fastest to deepest checks, with reproducible commands, admin checks, and recovery steps you can follow start-to-finish.</p><h2>Why this guide (and why 2025 matters)</h2>\n<p>Gmail’s core delivery model hasn’t changed: senders hand mail to MX records → Google’s mail servers accept and route → the mailbox (user account or Workspace account) stores it. But the environment around Gmail has evolved — more integrations, stronger auto-filters, widespread Workspace adoption, and heavier attachment/storage usage — so troubleshooting must cover both the classic causes and the newer, platform-level pitfalls. This guide merges official Google troubleshooting, community evidence, and field-tested steps so it stays relevant for years. </p><h2>High-level checklist (run this in order)</h2>\n<ol>\n  <li>Confirm sender's delivery status (ask sender for bounce message or delivery logs).</li>\n  <li>Check simple local issues: internet, device sync, app updates.</li>\n  <li>Inspect Gmail folders: Spam, All Mail, Trash, and filters/forwarding.</li>\n  <li>Verify account storage (15 GB free Google quota or Workspace limits).</li>\n  <li>If using a custom domain/Workspace: check MX records, DNS, and routing rules.</li>\n  <li>Check Google Workspace status & admin console for suspensions or routing rules.</li>\n  <li>Advanced: examine headers, logs, or ask sender to run SMTP tests (EHLO/MAIL FROM/RCPT TO) or check third-party blocking or reputation lists.</li>\n</ol><h2>Detailed step-by-step troubleshooting</h2><h3>1. Confirm the problem from the sender side (fastest verification)</h3>\n<p>Before changing anything, ask whoever sent the email to confirm they didn't get a bounce. If the sender has a bounce message, it usually contains the reason (e.g., <em>mailbox full</em>, <em>user unknown</em>, or <em>MX lookup failed</em>). If there’s a bounce, copy the bounce text exactly — it’s the single most helpful diagnostic.</p><p>If the sender reports successful delivery (no bounce), ask them to forward the original message or to send a plain-text test message to your address right now (subject: TEST). That helps separate a one-off delivery failure from a persistent routing problem.</p><h3>2. Quick local checks (client, device, network)</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Internet & connectivity:</strong> Try loading a website; if the network is flaky, Gmail might not sync. Check on another network or use mobile data to rule out local firewall/proxy issues.</li>\n  <li><strong>Gmail app / browser:</strong> Update the Gmail app to the latest version or open Gmail in Chrome/Edge. Use an incognito/private window to rule out extension interference.</li>\n  <li><strong>Sync settings:</strong> On Android & iOS, ensure background sync for Gmail is enabled. On desktop, verify that the browser is allowed to store cookies and run JavaScript. On mobile devices: Settings → Accounts → Google → select account → Sync Gmail (toggle on).</li>\n  <li><strong>Multiple clients:</strong> Test via https://mail.google.com in a browser and via the Gmail app. If one shows messages and the other doesn’t, the issue is client-specific.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These steps fix many user-level problems quickly. Lifewire’s troubleshooting checklist is a good reference for device-level steps. </p><h3>3. Check Gmail folders and search comprehensively</h3>\n<p>Gmail can hide mail via filters, archiving, or automatic classification. Run these checks:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Search for the sender address in the search box: <code>from:sender@example.com</code> and broaden to <code>has:nouserlabels</code> or <code>in:anywhere from:sender@example.com</code>. This searches Spam, Trash, and All Mail.</li>\n  <li>Open the <strong>Spam</strong> and <strong>Trash</strong> folders manually — messages are sometimes auto-classified.</li>\n  <li>Check <strong>Settings → Filters and Blocked Addresses</strong> for a filter that might be auto-archiving, deleting, or forwarding messages. Delete or edit any suspicious filters.</li>\n  <li>Check <strong>Settings → Forwarding and POP/IMAP</strong> to ensure messages are not being forwarded to another account that may be full or paused.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Community threads and Google support repeatedly show filters/forwarding and mis-specified rules are frequent stealth causes. Always run a full text search first — the message may be present but not visible.</p><h3>4. Verify storage: free Google accounts and Workspace quotas</h3>\n<p>If Google storage is full (Google Drive + Gmail + Photos share the same quota), you cannot receive new messages. A full mailbox often prevents delivery and causes silent failures until the sender receives a bounce. Steps:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Visit https://one.google.com/storage to see your current usage.</li>\n  <li>Free up space: delete large attachments, empty Spam & Trash, or move large files from Drive to offline storage.</li>\n  <li>For Workspace admins, verify organizational quotas and licensing — a suspended billing or exceeded user quota can prevent delivery for Workspace accounts. If your Workspace is managed, ask the admin to check the Admin console. </li>\n</ul><h3>5. Check for account suspension, disabled domain, or billing problems (Workspace)</h3>\n<p>For Google Workspace accounts, messages can bounce if the account or domain is suspended (billing, TOS, domain expiry). Admins should:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Open Admin console → Billing to confirm subscription is active.</li>\n  <li>Check Admin console → Users for suspended users.</li>\n  <li>Check domain registration (DNS provider) to ensure it hasn’t expired — an expired domain or DNS hosting can break MX resolution. Google’s troubleshoot page lists account suspension as a direct cause of non-delivery. </li>\n</ul><h3>6. DNS and MX records (custom domains / Workspace) — the critical infrastructure check</h3>\n<p>If you can send but not receive for a domain-based address (you@yourdomain.com), the most common root cause is misconfigured or missing MX records in DNS. Quick verification steps:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>From any terminal or online tool, run an MX lookup: <code>dig MX yourdomain.com +short</code> or use Google’s MX check tool at toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/checkmx/.</li>\n  <li>Confirm MX records point to Google’s servers (e.g., <code>ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM</code> and secondary hosts) and priority values are correct per Google’s setup instructions.</li>\n  <li>Check for stray MX records from old providers — multiple providers can create routing confusion or rejection.</li>\n  <li>Verify no “A” or “CNAME” records accidentally override mail routing for mail subdomains.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Multiple admins on Reddit and specialist blogs confirm that incorrect MX records are the single most frequent cause for domain-hosted Gmail to stop receiving messages. If records were recently changed, DNS propagation (TTL) can delay recovery by up to 48 hours in rare cases. </p><h3>7. Email routing, transport rules and third-party filtering (Workspace & hosted mail)</h3>\n<p>Workspace admins may set routing rules, compliance filters, or partner gateways that block or divert incoming mail. Steps to audit:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Admin console → Apps → Google Workspace → Gmail → Routing / Advanced settings. Temporarily disable suspicious routing rules.</li>\n  <li>Check if messages are routed through a third-party spam gateway (Proofpoint, Mimecast, Barracuda). If so, review those logs and quarantines.</li>\n  <li>Look for Content Compliance rules that *reject* messages matching certain patterns (attachments, DKIM/DMARC failures, message size limits).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you rely on a third-party filter, the issue may be upstream of Google — ask the provider for delivery logs. Reco.ai and other Workspace-focused writeups emphasize that routing rules and security appliances are a common enterprise failure point. </p><h3>8. Authentication, reputation, and DMARC/DKIM/SPF failures (sender-side causes)</h3>\n<p>Sometimes your mailbox is fine; the sender’s domain fails authentication and remote servers reject the message before it reaches Gmail. Confirm with the sender that they pass SPF, DKIM, and DMARC checks. As the recipient you can:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Ask the sender for their mail server logs and the SMTP transaction (look for 5xx/4xx errors).</li>\n  <li>Have the sender check their DNS for proper SPF records, DKIM signatures, and a valid DMARC policy.</li>\n  <li>If messages from multiple senders are missing, it's likely your account; if missing from one sender only, it’s likely their outbound configuration or reputation.</li>\n</ul><h3>9. Test with a controlled experiment</h3>\n<p>Run a short experiment to narrow the fault domain:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Ask Sender A (external, e.g., Gmail/Outlook) to send a plain-text email to youraddress@gmail.com.</li>\n  <li>Ask Sender B to send from a different provider (e.g., Outlook or Yahoo).</li>\n  <li>If you have a secondary account, send from your Gmail to that account and back again.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Record which messages arrive and which do not. If only a subset fails, you can identify patterns: one provider, one geographic region, large attachments, or certain content types.</p><h3>10. App/IMAP/POP issues — client-specific sync problems</h3>\n<p>If web Gmail shows mail but your desktop/mobile mail client doesn’t, the issue is client configuration:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>For IMAP, ensure <strong>Settings → Forwarding and POP/IMAP</strong> has IMAP enabled.</li>\n  <li>Check the client’s folder subscriptions and IMAP path prefix; ensure <em>All Mail</em> or <em>Inbox</em> is subscribed.</li>\n  <li>Remove and re-add the account in the client — this resets local caches, but keep a note of drafts or local-only folders first.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Many forum posts show removing + re-adding cleans a corrupted local cache and restores message flow. </p><h3>11. Security incidents — compromised account or account hijack</h3>\n<p>If your account was recently accessed from an unfamiliar device, Google may temporarily restrict incoming mail for protection or attackers may have set forwarding rules to siphon mail. Immediate steps:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Go to <strong>myaccount.google.com/security</strong> and check Recent security events and Devices.</li>\n  <li>Check <strong>Settings → Forwarding and POP/IMAP</strong> for unknown forwarding addresses and remove them.</li>\n  <li>Change your password, enable 2-Step Verification, and review Security Checkup in your Google Account.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Community support and official pages show attackers commonly create hidden forwarding rules — remove any you don’t recognize.</p><h3>12. When to contact Google support or your domain host</h3>\n<p>Contact Google support (or your Workspace admin) when:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>You’re a Workspace customer and receiving a domain-wide delivery failure or bounce.</li>\n  <li>MX records look correct but mail still doesn’t arrive after DNS propagation and routing checks.</li>\n  <li>Account suspension or billing fixes are required.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For domains, also open a support ticket with your DNS provider if MX records appear incorrect or you suspect DNS-level blocking. Provide timestamps, sender IPs, and sample message headers to make their log search effective.</p><h2>Recovery examples & real-world playbooks</h2><h3>Scenario A — Personal Gmail: “No mail from one contact”</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li>Ask sender for bounce/test email. If none, search in Gmail: <code>in:anywhere from:sender@example.com</code>.</li>\n  <li>Check Spam, Filters, and Blocked Addresses; remove block or filter.</li>\n  <li>If still not found, ask sender to send a tiny test message. If that fails but others succeed, temporarily disable any forwarding or third-party add-ons and retry.</li>\n</ol><h3>Scenario B — Workspace domain: “All inbound mail stopped”</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li>Admin: check Admin Console for suspended users or billing issues.</li>\n  <li>Run MX lookup and confirm Google MX records are present and correct (use Google’s MX check tool).</li>\n  <li>Check routing rules and third-party gateways; temporarily bypass them.</li>\n  <li>If DNS/records are correct and problem persists, open a Google Workspace support case with your diagnostic headers and timestamps. 9</li>\n</ol><h3>Scenario C — Intermittent delivery / some messages missing</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li>Audit content compliance and spam rules for patterns (attachments, keyword blocks, sender domains).</li>\n  <li>Look at sender SPF/DKIM/DMARC; ask the sender for headers if possible.</li>\n  <li>Set up a temporary catch-all or test alias to see if messages route elsewhere.</li>\n</ol><h2>Tools and commands (quick reference)</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li>MX lookup: <code>dig MX yourdomain.com +short</code> or use Google’s MX check tool at toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/checkmx/.</li>\n  <li>Check Google storage: https://one.google.com/storage</li>\n  <li>Admin console: https://admin.google.com → Apps → Google Workspace → Gmail → Routing</li>\n  <li>Search in Gmail: <code>in:anywhere from:email@example.com</code>, <code>has:attachment filename:pdf</code></li>\n</ul><h2>Preventive steps (reduce future recurrence)</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li>Monitor storage and set periodic reminders to remove large attachments or buy Google One if you rely heavily on attachments.</li>\n  <li>Use a mail log retention policy and enable audit logs in Workspace for admins.</li>\n  <li>For custom domains, set low MX TTL while troubleshooting to speed propagation during fixes, then increase TTL once stable.</li>\n  <li>Harden account security: 2FA, security keys, periodic security reviews, and remove stale forwarding rules.</li>\n</ul><h2>Diagnosing with message headers — a primer</h2>\n<p>When a sender shares the raw message or your own received mail, examine the headers for the SMTP relay path (Received: lines). Key checks:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Look for the first non-Google <code>Received:</code> header to see where the mail was handed off.</li>\n  <li>Find any rejection codes (5xx) in bounce text.</li>\n  <li>Check Authentication-Results for SPF/DKIM/DMARC pass/fail.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Understanding headers lets you tell whether the message reached Google and was routed elsewhere (e.g., quarantined) or whether it was never accepted. If Google accepted it, there will be a Received line from Google’s servers — if not, the failure is upstream. This is the most robust way to avoid guesswork when mail appears lost.</p><h2>Troubleshooting checklist you can copy & paste</h2>\n<ol>\n  <li>Confirm sender bounce or successful send (get the raw bounce if present).</li>\n  <li>Search Gmail: <code>in:anywhere from:sender@example.com</code>.</li>\n  <li>Check Spam, All Mail, Trash.</li>\n  <li>Inspect Filters and Forwarding (Settings).</li>\n  <li>Verify storage at https://one.google.com/storage.</li>\n  <li>For domains: run <code>dig MX yourdomain.com</code> or Google MX check.</li>\n  <li>Check Admin Console for suspensions, routing rules, or third-party gateways.</li>\n  <li>If compromised: change password, remove unknown forwarding, enable 2FA.</li>\n  <li>Contact Google Support / domain host with headers and timestamps when stuck.</li>\n</ol><h2>Common myths & mistakes</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Myth:</strong> Gmail “loses” messages frequently. <strong>Reality:</strong> Most “missing” mail is in Spam/All Mail or rerouted by filters, forwarding rules, or MX misconfiguration.</li>\n  <li><strong>Myth:</strong> Deleting and reinstalling the Gmail app will fix mail server issues. <strong>Reality:</strong> That only helps client cache problems; server-side issues remain until addressed.</li>\n  <li><strong>Myth:</strong> Google support can read deleted messages and recover everything. <strong>Reality:</strong> If the message never reached Google (MX failure, blocked at sender), there is nothing for Google to recover. Provide headers and bounce messages to accelerate support. </li>\n</ul><h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><h3>Q: Why am I not receiving emails in my Gmail but can still send them?</h3>\n<p>A: Common causes: full Google storage quota, filters/forwarding moving messages out of Inbox, or (for custom domains) incorrect MX/DNS records. Run a full search (<code>in:anywhere</code>), check storage at one.google.com, and verify MX records if you use a domain. </p><h3>Q: How do I check if Google experienced an outage that affected receiving mail?</h3>\n<p>A: Check the Google Workspace Status Dashboard and the Gmail Help Community. If Google has a wider outage, many users will report it and Google shows it on the status dashboard. For account-level issues, the Admin Console will also show disruptions. </p><h3>Q: Messages from one company never reach my inbox — what should I ask them to check?</h3>\n<p>A: Ask them for the SMTP bounce or delivery logs, and ask them to verify their SPF, DKIM, and DMARC configurations. Also have them send a plain-text test message (no attachments or HTML) — that rules out attachment-size or content filters.</p><h3>Q: I found unknown forwarding in my Gmail — is my account hacked?</h3>\n<p>A: Possibly. Remove the forwarding rule immediately, change your password, sign out all devices from your Google Account security page, and enable 2-Step Verification. Review recent security events and run the Google Security Checkup.</p><h3>Q: I use Google Workspace and recently changed DNS — how long until mail works again?</h3>\n<p>A: DNS propagation is usually quick (minutes–hours) but can take up to 48 hours depending on TTL values and upstream DNS caches. If MX records are correct but mail still doesn't arrive after a few hours, re-check records for typos and consult your DNS provider. </p><h2>Conclusion — where to start now</h2>\n<p>Start with the simplest checks: run a search in Gmail, confirm sender bounce status, and verify storage. If you use a custom domain or Workspace, then prioritize MX and routing checks next. Keep records of timestamps, sender addresses, and any bounce text — they are the keys for fast resolution. If you reach support, providing headers and a clear timeline will move the case from “weird” to solvable.</p><p><strong>Call to action:</strong> Run the checklist above now — begin with a targeted search (<code>in:anywhere from:sender@example.com</code>) and check your Google storage at https://one.google.com/storage. If you want, paste a sample bounce message or header here and I’ll help interpret it step-by-step.</p>\n\n<div class=\"related-articles\">\n  <h3>Related Articles</h3>\n  <ul>\n    <li><a href=\"/posts/gmail-login-problems-fix.html\" title=\"Gmail Login Problems Fix Now — Desktop & Mobile Recovery Today\">Gmail Login Problems Fix Now — Desktop & Mobile Recovery Today</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"/posts/protect-gmail-from-hackers-phishing.html\" title=\"How to Protect Gmail from Hackers & Phishing | 2025 Guide\">How to Protect Gmail from Hackers & Phishing | 2025 Guide</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"/posts/enable-2-step-verification-gmail.html\" title=\"How to Enable 2-Step Verification on Gmail | 2025 Guide\">How to Enable 2-Step Verification on Gmail | 2025 Guide</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"/posts/gmail-passkeys-guide.html\" title=\"How to Use Gmail Passkeys (2025 Security Guide)\">How to Use Gmail Passkeys (2025 Security Guide)</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"/posts/recover-gmail-password-without-phone-or-email.html\" title=\"Recover Gmail Password Without Phone or Email | 2025 Guide\">Recover Gmail Password Without Phone or Email | 2025 Guide</a></li>\n  </ul>\n</div>\n\n\n<!--\nhttps://support.google.com/a/answer/11112228?hl=en\nhttps://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/checkmx/\nhttps://one.google.com/storage\nhttps://www.lifewire.com/fix-gmail-not-working-on-android-7099022\n-->\n    </article>\n  </main>\n  <script>\n    window.postMetadata = window.postMetadata || {};\n  </script>\n\n <script src=\"/assets/seo-enhancer.js\"></script>\n</body>\n</html>"
